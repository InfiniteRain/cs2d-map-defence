# Disclaimer

Years ago, back when I was still a child/teenager, I used to be an active modder of a game called [CS2D](http://cs2d.com/). All of my mods/plugins are currently uploaded over at [Unreal Software's website](http://unrealsoftware.de). In Summer 2019, I decided that I will upload my entire catalogue of projects related to the game onto GitHub so that my work is still hosted somewhere in a case of Unreal Software ever going down. Another reason for this decision is purely sentimental, as I want to be able to look back and reflect on what I was back then compared to what I am today. So before you read any of the code, please take into consideration that I wasn't very experienced back then.
